My tech stack mostly revolves around <b>TypeScript</b>, but I am also fluent in <b>PHP</b>. That being said, I am also proficient in other languages like <b>Python</b>, and I am currently learning <b>Rust</b> and <b>Go</b> to improve across the entire web stack. As you can see, my main set of skills lays in <b>Web Development</b>, but this is not limiting.</p><br /><p>On the <b>DevOps</b> side of things, I am experienced in using <b>AWS</b> together with <b>Terraform</b> to provision the likes of <b>S3</b>, <b>CloudFront</b> & <b>ECS</b>. Across development, staging and production, I am also knowledgeable in the setups using both <b>Docker</b> and <b>Docker Compose</b> to create a reproducible environment for easy deployment with <b>CI/CD</b>.</p><br /><p>I have experience working both with <b>Monoliths</b> and <b>Micro-services</b>, and <b>refactoring</b> both has been my task more than once. Recently I had the pleasure of <b>leading a project</b> where refactoring and <b>optimizing</b> an entire codebase was on the table, and being the lead of such a project taught me many lessons.</p><br /><p>But enough about me for now. If you are interested in getting to know me better or you would like to have me work on your next project, give me a ping on one of the platforms below.</p>",
